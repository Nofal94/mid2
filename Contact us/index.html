    <div class="cake"> About us <h3>The idea of this website is having different kind of candy from different countries which can be purchased easily in this website. I ceared this website because I lived away from my home for 5 years and I really miss most of the candy we have back home and i thought how wonderful it is if there is a way to get those candy delivered to my home with no complication.
            I don't want this place to be just about me i want all people to experience, try and get to know different countries and whats better way to understand than sweets.</h3>
