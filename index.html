            <h3>A website that love to share the experience of happiness enjoy to the world by sharing different cultural candy to worldwide consumers</h3>
            <h4>
                    
                      </h4>
    </div>

            <div></div>
            <div>The idea of this website is having different kind of candy from different countries which can be purchased easily in this website. I ceared this website because I lived away from my home for 5 years and I really miss most of the candy we have back home and i thought how wonderful it is if there is a way to get those candy delivered to my home with no complication.
                    I don't want this place to be just about me i want all people to experience, try and get to know different countries and whats better way to understand than sweets.</div>
